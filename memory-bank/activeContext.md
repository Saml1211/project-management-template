# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

*   Maintaining the established project organization structure.
*   Ensuring README.md files are present and up-to-date in all directories.
*   Creating and refining visualizations for the directory structure.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the `memory-bank` directory and core files.
*   Defined and documented the Project Brief (`projectbrief.md`).
*   Defined and documented the Product Context (`productContext.md`).
*   Defined and documented the System Patterns (`systemPatterns.md`).
*   Defined and documented the Tech Context (`techContext.md`).
*   Added detailed README.md files to the main directories: Personal, Work, Uncategorized, ui-library, OpenSource, and MCP.
*   Enhanced the main README.md with directory trees and mermaid diagrams for better visualization of the workspace structure and project workflow.
*   Optimized mermaid diagrams to ensure they're visible in both dark and light modes.

## Next Steps

*   Continue maintaining the Memory Bank with updates as the project evolves.
*   Implement the `/sort_imports` workflow when new repositories are added.
*   Keep all README.md files up to date as the directory structure changes.
*   Consider creating a .cursor/rules/journal.mdc file to capture project-specific patterns and workflows.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   The core Memory Bank documentation structure is established and operational.
*   The reliance on the AI assistant for file management and adherence to `AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` is confirmed as a key operational pattern.
*   Visualization of the workspace structure through mermaid diagrams has been established as a valuable documentation approach.
