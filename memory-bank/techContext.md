# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

*   **Core:** Operating System File System (macOS APFS/HFS+ inferred from user info).
*   **Interaction:** Shell environment (zsh inferred) for basic file/directory commands (`mkdir`, `mv`, `ls`, `tree`, `cat`).
*   **Documentation:** Markdown (`.md`) format.
*   **Automation:** AI Assistant (Cursor/Gemini) utilizing its tools for file system access, terminal commands, and search.

## Development Setup

*   Not applicable in the traditional coding sense.
*   Initial setup involves creating the directory structure (`Work/`, `Personal/`, etc.) and essential documentation (`AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`, `memory-bank/` files).
*   Ongoing "development" is the maintenance and evolution of this structure and its documentation via user prompts and AI actions.

## Technical Constraints

*   **AI Interpretation:** System behavior depends on the AI assistant accurately interpreting user requests and the rules in `AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`.
*   **File System Limits:** Potential OS-specific limitations (e.g., path length, allowed characters).
*   **User Adherence:** Relies on the user consistently following the import workflow (using `_Import/`).

## Dependencies

*   **Host Environment:** User's operating system (macOS) and shell (zsh).
*   **AI Platform:** The Cursor AI Assistant platform and its backend capabilities/available tools.
