# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

*   Establish predefined top-level categories for repositories: `Work`, `Personal`, `OpenSource`, `MCP`, `Uncategorized` (temporary), and `_Import` (staging).
*   Implement a specific sub-categorization within the `MCP` directory: `OpenSource`, `Personal`, `Management`.
*   Define a clear workflow for importing and sorting new repositories using the `_Import` directory and an AI-triggered command (`/sort_imports`).
*   Ensure all repositories have a `README.md`, creating a basic one if missing.
*   Maintain accurate documentation (root `README.md`, `AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`) reflecting the structure and rules.

## Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** To maintain a consistently organized and categorized structure for all software development repositories within the `/Projects` workspace, managed with AI assistance according to defined rules.

## Scope

*   **Included:** Organization of repository directories within the `/Projects` root, management rules for AI assistants, documentation of the structure and process.
*   **Excluded:** Management of files *within* individual repositories beyond ensuring a `README.md` exists, specific development tasks within projects.
