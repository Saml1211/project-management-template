# Progress

## What Works

*   Memory Bank directory structure created and all core files populated.
*   Project goals, structure, system patterns, and tech context are documented.
*   README.md files have been created for all main directories.
*   Main README.md includes comprehensive directory trees and visualization diagrams.
*   Mermaid diagrams show workspace structure and project workflow with optimized visibility for both dark and light modes.

## What's Left to Build

*   Ongoing maintenance and updates to the Memory Bank as the project evolves.
*   Potential creation of additional context files/folders within `memory-bank/` if complexity warrants it.
*   Creation of a .cursor/rules/journal.mdc file to capture project-specific patterns and workflows.
*   Implementation of the `/sort_imports` command workflow when needed.

## Current Status

*   Memory Bank setup and population complete.
*   README.md files created for all main directories with detailed information.
*   Visual documentation of the workspace structure established.
*   The project organization system is fully operational and ready for ongoing maintenance.

## Known Issues

*   None identified related to the structure or documentation itself.
*   Potential issues may arise from future deviations from the defined workflow (e.g., incorrect AI interpretation, user not using `_Import`).
